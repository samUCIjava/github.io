## Course Registration System Project

Console-based application that serves as a course registration system. The system will be used by a local college to
register students for courses and also for students to self-register. The data for the
registration system is stored in text files.

### Structure:
Registration system contains three screens: 
* A screen that shows the list of courses available and the ability to register for
one,
* A registration status screen that denotes either success or failure upon
registration, and
* A student profile page that shows a list of classes that the student is already
registered for.

The system provides several features:
* The ability for students to view an alphabetical list of courses that includes the
course identification number, course dates, name, brief summary, the enrollment
limit, and the number of students already enrolled.
* The ability for students to register or un-register for a course.
* The ability for a student to see a list of classes for which he/she is currently
registered.
